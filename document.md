Here are the IDs that were changed:

1. **Dropdown Toggle IDs:**
   - **Original ID:** `data-dropdown-toggle="dropdown"`
   - **Updated IDs:**
     - For the "Translate From" dropdown: `data-dropdown-toggle="dropdownFrom"`
     - For the "Translate Into" dropdown: `data-dropdown-toggle="dropdownTo"`

2. **Dropdown Menu IDs:**
   - **Original ID:** `id="dropdown"`
   - **Updated IDs:**
     - For the "Translate From" dropdown: `id="dropdownFrom"`
     - For the "Translate Into" dropdown: `id="dropdownTo"`

These changes ensure that each dropdown menu is associated with its respective toggle button, preventing content overlap.

The issue you're facing with dropdowns not responding to clicks could be due to several factors:

### 1. **Performance Issues**:
   - **Large Number of Items**: Having 100+ items in each dropdown can slow down the rendering and responsiveness, especially if the dropdowns are not optimized for such a large number of items.
   - **DOM Manipulation**: If your dropdowns require frequent DOM updates (e.g., being re-rendered or manipulated), this could lead to sluggish performance, particularly in older browsers or on slower devices.

### 2. **Event Listener Overload**:
   - **Multiple Event Listeners**: If multiple event listeners are attached to the dropdowns, they might conflict or overload the browser, causing the dropdowns to become unresponsive.
   - **Heavy JavaScript Execution**: Any heavy JavaScript operations triggered by dropdown interactions (e.g., API calls, animations) can cause the UI to freeze momentarily, making it seem like the dropdowns aren't responding.

### 3. **Flowbite Library**:
   - **Compatibility**: There could be compatibility issues between the Flowbite CDN and other libraries or frameworks you are using, especially if they are not optimized to handle a large number of dropdown items.
   - **Render Blocking**: The Flowbite library might be causing render-blocking, delaying the interaction response.

### 4. **CSS and Layout Issues**:
   - **Overflow and Visibility**: CSS issues such as overflow, z-index, or visibility properties might prevent the dropdown from being properly clicked, especially if they are partially hidden or covered by other elements.
   - **Animation and Transition Effects**: If you have complex CSS animations or transitions applied to the dropdowns, they could interfere with responsiveness, especially if they are not optimized.

### Recommendations:
1. **Optimize Dropdowns**:
   - **Lazy Loading**: Consider implementing lazy loading for the dropdown items, only rendering them as the user scrolls or types, rather than loading all 100+ items at once.
   - **Virtualization**: Use virtualization techniques to render only a subset of items visible in the viewport, which can significantly improve performance.

2. **Debounce API Calls**: If you are making API calls based on dropdown selections, debounce these calls to reduce the load on your server and avoid overwhelming the browser.

3. **Test with Minimal Setup**: Try removing the Flowbite library temporarily or reducing the number of items to see if the issue persists. This can help isolate whether the problem lies with the library or the number of items.

4. **Browser DevTools**: Use browser developer tools to profile the performance and check for any console errors or warnings that might give you more clues about what is causing the issue.

5. **Reduce Animation Complexity**: Simplify or remove any CSS animations or transitions on the dropdowns to see if it improves responsiveness.
